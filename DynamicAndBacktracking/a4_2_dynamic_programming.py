#Given an `n * n` square matrix with integer values, find the maximum length of a snake sequence.
# A snake sequence begins on the matrix's top row (coordinate `(0, i), 0 <= i < n`).
# Each element of the sequence, except the first one, must have a value `Â±1` from the previous one
# and be located directly below, or directly to the right of the previous element.
# For example, element `(i, j)` can be succeded by one of the `(i, j + 1)` or `(i + 1, j)` elements.
# Display the length as well as the sequence of coordinates for one sequence of maximum length.
